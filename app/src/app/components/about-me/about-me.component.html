      <p>Hi, there! I'm Justin, a rising senior studying Computer Science at the University of Rochester. I'm passionate
      about everything computers, from emulators to full stack web applications to ML. Name it, I'm probably into it.
      Currently, I'm learning more about the Cloud and how it can be utilized to create robust and scalable applications.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I'm putting that into practice as a Software Developer Intern at the Federal Reserve, where I support
      Treasury operations by managing and deploying critical cloud infrastructure using AWS, Terraform, and Kubernetes. To
      deepen my knowledge, I even recently obtained my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification!</p>
      <br>
      <p></p>Please reach out to me if you have any open opportunities!</p>
